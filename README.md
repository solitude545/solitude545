👋 Hi, I’m @solitude545

👀 I’m interested in exploring the vast realms of software development, from web development to machine learning and everything in between.

🌱 I’m currently learning about containerization with Docker and diving deeper into Python frameworks like Flask and Django.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that challenge me and allow me to contribute meaningfully to the community.

📫 How to reach me: Drop me a message here on GitHub or reach out via email at yoonusuns69@gmail.com .

😄 Pronouns: he

⚡ Fun fact: I have a passion for astronomy and enjoy stargazing whenever I get the chance.
